### About Me
I introduce myself as an enthusiastic student who is passionate about learning new technologies and methods to make people's routines more efficient and reliable. I am currently studying at SLIIT CITY UNI, pursuing a computer science degree. I also tend to gain knowledge of new technologies and strategies through self-study in my free time. Persistent effort and credibility in my work are significant to me to make a bright outlook on myself and I always try to overcome my weaknesses and setbacks through experiences.

Majorly interested in Operating Systems, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, DevOps, Cloud Computing, and high-level programming languages such as C and C++. In addition, I am interested in developing comprehensive web applications using technology stacks that use Next.js (React framework), Tailwind CSS, Fast API (python), Microsoft Azure storage, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, Selenium, and Git according to problem definitions. As reflections, recently created projects are given in the GitHub account.
